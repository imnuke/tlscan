Analyze the code for SSL/TLS client security compliance and output JSON matching this schema:

{{
  "client_type": "OpenSSL|libcurl|mbedTLS|GnuTLS|etc",
  "rules": [
    {{
      "rule_id": "R2",
      "rule_name": "Certificate Chain Verification",
      "result": "pass|fail|conditional|undetermined",
      "evidence": "detailed evidence with function names and addresses",
      "conditions": []  // for conditional, list variables to trace
    }}
  ],
  "summary": "human-readable summary",
  "applicable": true|false,
  "reason": null|"why not applicable"
}}

For conditional result, include conditions array with:
{{
  "variable": "v20",  // ACTUAL variable name from pseudocode, NOT descriptive names
  "function": "upscli_init",
  "function_address": "0x5be7",
  "security_mapping": {{"0": "fail", "1": "pass"}}
}}

CRITICAL for conditions:
- Use ACTUAL variable names from the code (e.g., "v20", "a1", "param2", "$SSL_VERIFY")
- DO NOT make up descriptive names like "verify_flag" or "ssl_mode"
- The dataflow agent will search for these exact variable names in the code
- Example: If code shows "if (v20 != 0)" or "if [ $SSL_VERIFY ]", use the actual variable name

RESULT TYPE RULES:
- PASS: Option set to secure value, OR option not set and default is secure
- FAIL: Option set to insecure value, OR option not set and default is insecure
- CONDITIONAL: Option value is a RUNTIME VARIABLE that needs tracing
  - MUST have non-empty conditions array with actual variable names
  - Do NOT use for cross-rule dependencies or "effectively disabled" scenarios
- UNDETERMINED: Cannot locate relevant code

IMPORTANT: Evaluate each rule INDEPENDENTLY. If one rule's failure affects another's
effectiveness, note it in evidence, do NOT use CONDITIONAL for this relationship.

SECURITY RULES TO CHECK:

{security_rules_content}

{'=' * 60}
KEY INSTRUCTIONS:
{'=' * 60}

1. Verify the code has SSL/TLS CLIENT functionality (SSL_connect, curl_easy_perform, wget, curl commands, etc.)
2. If not applicable, set applicable=false with reason
3. Check ALL rules from the security rules above
4. Use available tools to analyze the code and find SSL/TLS settings
5. For values determined at runtime, use conditional result with conditions
6. Provide detailed evidence with function names, line numbers, and actual variable names
7. For conditional rules, use EXACT variable names from the code (NOT made-up descriptive names)
8. Run ONCE and analyze all rules in single pass
9. Output ONLY valid JSON matching the schema above

Use the available tools to explore the code structure, find function calls, and trace variable values.
